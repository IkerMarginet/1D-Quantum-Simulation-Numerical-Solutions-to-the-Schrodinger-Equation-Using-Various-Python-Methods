# 1D-Quantum-Simulation-Numerical-Solutions-to-the-Schrodinger-Equation-Using-Various-Python-Methods
This project implements numerical methods to solve the one-dimensional time-independent Schr√∂dinger equation in Python. Different approaches are explored, including finite difference and matrix diagonalization techniques, to compute eigenvalues and eigenfunctions for various potential wells.
